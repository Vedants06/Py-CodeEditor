# Py-CodeEditor
A web-based Python compiler built to explore how IDEs and online compilers function. Using Pyodide, the project enables Python code execution directly in the browser through WebAssembly. Users can run code, input custom data, view outputs, and submit solutions to predefined coding problems.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly)

## Features
- Run Python code directly in the browser.
- Custom input and output functionality for testing.
- Predefined problems to solve, with sample input and expected output.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start coding and testing your Python code directly in the browser!

## Future Improvements
- Support for additional programming languages.
- Enhanced UI/UX for better usability.
- More advanced problem sets for users to practice coding.
